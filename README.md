# Summary

### Our report mainly uses datasets sourced from Zillow Real Estate to analyse house information in Washington state. We also use datasets from data.gov to analysis high school dropout rate and  population density across counties to provide more perspectives for our users when choosing their desired place to live. 


### In this report, three questions will be answered:

-	What is the overall trend in a 3-bedroom house value over the past years?

-	Is it a better decision to rent or buy a 3-bedroom house in Washington state?

-	What counties have the ideal characteristics for a 3-bedroom house in Washington state?



## Detailed Background 
>Our target audience is a real estate agent looking to show a house to a family of four interested in a 3-bedroom property in Washington state. This is the ideal dataset considering our combined datasets, because with information related to high school dropout rates and population densities, families are aware which counties experience the highest dropout rate or are overcrowded areas.  They would ideally like to settle down near proper amenities such as good schools, restaurants, shopping, etc. We link this back to the information we currently have that looks at future housing rates, current rental values, and their locations. Calculating information related to where the typical family (family of four requiring 3 bedrooms) in the state of Washington can find prime information is the ideal conclusion from the data sorting. 
#### Additionally the datasets are useful because they allow real estate agents to examine trends in housing and make predictions on what rates will be in the future. They allow comparing trends across different categories much easier; for example, dropping high school dropout rates should see increased retail in county locations.
